Documentation of the OSeMOSYS Kenya WESM
========================================

The Kenya Whole Energy System Model (WESM) is a linear optimisation model of the entire Kenyan energy system, developed in OSeMOSYS. The model contains a detailed description of the power sector, as well as all other major sectors driving energy demand in Kenya, namely the agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential, and transport sectors.

This documentation is intended to be model-specific, while a complete description of the OSeMOSYS modelling framework can be accessed at its `dedicated webpage <https://osemosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
